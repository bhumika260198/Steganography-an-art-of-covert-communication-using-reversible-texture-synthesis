# Steganography-an-art-of-covert-communication-using-reversible-texture-synthesis
It is supposed to propose a unique approach for steganography using a reversible texture synthesis. A texture synthesis method re-samples a smaller texture image that synthesizes a brand-new texture image with the same native look and impulsive size. We weave the feel synthesis method into steganography to conceal secret messages. In distinction to exploitation associate existing cowl image to cover messages, our rule conceals the supply texture image and embeds secret messages through the method of texture synthesis. This permits us to extract secret messages and also the supply texture from a stego artificial texture. Our approach offers 3 distinct benefits. First, our theme offers the embedding capacity that's proportional to the scale of the stego texture image. Second, a steganalytic rule isn't doubtless to defeat our steganographic approach. Third, the reversible capability inherited from our theme provides practicality that permits recovery of the supply texture. Experimental results have verified that
